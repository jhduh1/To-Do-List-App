# To-Do-List-App
A simple app where you can add, remove and cut off your to do lists. The app is made using HTML, CSS and Jquery.
Simply put all the files in the same directory and open the Todolist html file using a web browser(chrome preferred).
Add your to do list in the "Add New Todo" placeholder.
CLick on the plus icon to toggle your placeholder.
CLick on the trash font icon to delete your existing to do lists(it comes with three lists by default).
Click on the to do lists(not the trash icon) to simply cutoff your to do lists and not permanently delete it.
